# How to Deploy a Keras Model to Production


## Overview

 We're going to build a model that recognizes handwritten digit images (MNIST).  Developed using [TensorFlow] and the super simple [Keras]Library. Wrapped into a Webapp using [Flask]Micro Framework.

## Dependencies

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run this to see it in your browser. 

```python app.py```

That's it! It's serving a saved Keras model to you via Flask.
